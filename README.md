# SIMS : CONSOLE EDITION
> This is a Java application that demonstrates how to use abstract classes. The Sims game is a popular game that allows you to build households and families. You can also watch the households perform daily household actions and watch the results. This application uses abstract classes and interfaces to introduce the idea of abstraction in Java.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
* [JAVA](https://www.java.com/en/) - A programming language and computing platform
* [INTELLIJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - The IDE used to write Java code

### APPROACH TAKEN
I started by making a the files first. I started with an abstract class, an interface and a regular class. I struggled with figuring out which of the classes should be used to represent which part of the household. The goal was to allow the program to construct two households and to watch the households perform their activities on a loop. I used an ENHANCED FOR LOOP to perform the methods of the households which I chose to store in an ArrayList.

### GETTING STARTED
Open the application's java file in the browser or in an environment that provides access to the console. Enter the values that are prompted to play the game!
